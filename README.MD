# Object Oriented Programming
#Encapsulation
According to Downey, "wrapping a piece of code up in a 
function is called encapsulation." Encapsulation makes the 
internal representation of the function can't be seen from 
outside the function's definition (Klein).

    class Encapsulation (object):
        def__init__(self, a, b, c):
            self.public = a
            self._protected = b
            self.__private = c
The indented functions under the class Encapsulation are examples
of encapsulated data.

#Abstraction
Like encapsulation, abstraction is "hiding the complexity and 
only showing the essential features of the object" (Anshudeep).
As with the example given for encapsulation, abstraction would be the 
indented code within the class attribute.
